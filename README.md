OrgPulse-Organ Donation Website

A dynamic web application built using PHP and MySQL that enables users to register as organ donors or patients in need. The platform is designed to bridge the gap between potential donors and patients by managing profiles and streamlining communication.

Features:

-  User Registration & Login (Donors and Patients)
-  Register as a Donor or Patient
-  View List of Registered Donors and Patients
-  Secure authentication and session management
-  Dashboard for organ availability

Deployment

Since the website is developed using PHP and MySQL, we couldn't deploy it for free on platforms like GitHub Pages or Vercel (which support only static frontends or Node.js). 

Hence, we've included screenshots below for a better visual understanding of the working application.
